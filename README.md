# E-Library System

This online E-Library System is a MySQL-based project designed to manage book availability, loans, and user reviews efficiently. The system currently provides three core functionalities: checking book availability, loaning books, and reviewing books. It also allows users to view all books in the library.

The source code here (a mix of Python and SQL) includes main function to demonstrate the functionality of this program. I have added comments to describe the functions when they are declared and when they are being called. I am using the command 'python elibrary.py' to run the code.
